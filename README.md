This code attempts to use horiztonal spray data in calculating xwOBA. Overall, the results were less accurate than MLB's xwOBA. 
The code may take a few minutes to run, (the query is quite large).
I will make uodates to the code and this readme file in the upcoming weeks. I am simply preoccupied with finals right now.
